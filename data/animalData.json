The genus Nesiotites (Late Miocene/Early Pliocene-Holocene) from the Balearic Islands, including the chronospecies N. rafelinensis (earliest Pliocene), N. ponsi (Late Pliocene) and N. hidalgo (Middle Pleistocene-Holocene) is considered to descend from Asoriculus, likely A. gibberodon. The insular species of Asoriculus from Sicily and Corsica-Sardinia were formerly included in Nesiotites, but Nesiotites was later circumscribed to only include the Balearic species, as otherwise the genus would likely be polyphyletic. The last Nesiotites chronospecies, N. hidalgo, became extinct shortly after human settlement of the Balearics around 2500 BC. Both the insular species of Asoriculus and Nesiotites are larger than A. gibberodon, which has been suggested to be the result of island gigantism, with the Nesiotites lineage experiencing a gradual increase in size over time.

Like living ruffed lemurs, Pachylemur specialized in eating fruit, and was therefore an important seed disperser, possibly for tree species with seeds too large for even ruffed lemurs to swallow.  In the spiny thickets of southwestern Madagascar, they were also likely to have dispersed seeds evolved to attach to fur and be carried away.

Its feet were yellow and large relative to the bird's overall size. The wingspan was 60–70 cm, its wings being more rounded than those of the common kestrel - just as in the Mauritius bird - for increased maneuvrability when hunting in the forest.

It was the only species in the genus Psephurus and one of two recent species of paddlefish (Polyodontidae), the other being the American paddlefish (Polyodon spathula).

This bird inhabited only the wetter, easternmost side of Maui, where it had rapidly decreased in numbers. With extinction threatening, efforts were made to capture birds to enable them to breed in captivity. These efforts were unsuccessful; in 2004, only two known birds remained, and since then, no further birds have been sighted.
